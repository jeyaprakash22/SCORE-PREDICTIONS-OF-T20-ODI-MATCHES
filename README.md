# SCORE-PREDICTIONS-OF-T20-ODI-MATCHES
## 1. Overview
### Objective
  * The T20 and ODI Match Prediction Models are designed to predict the score and win-loss probabilities of cricket matches in real-time. These models leverage machine learning techniques, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and ensemble methods, to deliver accurate predictions based on historical and live match data.

  * The models are integrated into a mobile application, providing users with live updates on match outcomes, helping fans and analysts track the progress of ongoing matches.

## 2. Approach
### Data Sources
  * MySQL Database: Stores match data, player statistics, team performances, and historical match results.
  * Live Match Data: Real-time data is fetched during matches and used for score and probability predictions.
### Machine Learning Models
  * Score Prediction: Predicts the score of a team based on various factors such as innings number, player performance, and match conditions.
  * Win-Loss Probability: Calculates the likelihood of a team winning or losing based on ongoing match data and historical trends.
### Techniques Used
  * Artificial Neural Networks (ANN): Used for accurate, complex pattern recognition in predicting scores and win probabilities.
  * Ensemble Models: Combine multiple machine learning algorithms to improve prediction accuracy and reliability.
### Model Integration
  * The prediction models are integrated into a mobile application, allowing users to receive real-time updates and forecasts.
Predictions are updated dynamically as new match data (such as runs, wickets, overs, etc.) becomes available.
### 3. Key Features
  * Real-Time Predictions: As the match progresses, the models update predictions for score potential and win-loss probability.
  * Historical Data Usage: The models are trained using a large dataset of past T20 and ODI matches, improving prediction accuracy.
  * Mobile App Integration: Users can access predictions on their mobile devices during live matches, offering an engaging fan experience.
### 4. Conclusion
The T20 and ODI match prediction models combine cutting-edge machine learning techniques with real-time data processing to deliver precise and timely match outcomes. By integrating these predictions into a mobile application, the models enhance fan engagement and provide valuable insights for match analysis.
